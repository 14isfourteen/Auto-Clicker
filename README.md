## 💬 A Note from the Author

This is the first piece of software I've built from scratch since choosing to major in programming. It started with a simple goal: to help a classmate skip through game dialogues.

I know there are many similar tools out there, but I wanted to create my own—a clean, ad-free application that carries a piece of my own story and effort. I hope you enjoy using it!
